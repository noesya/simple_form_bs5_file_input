# simple_form_bs5_file_input

A nice improvement for the `file` field in [Simple Form](https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form).

**Simple Form Bootstrap 5 File Input** aims to add directs controls to your file fields in Simple Form.


## Installation

Add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simple_form_bs5_file_input'
```

Run the following command to install it:

```console
bundle install
```

Add it to your application.sass:

```
@import 'simple_form_bs5_file_input'
```

Add it to your application.js:

```
//= require simple_form_bs5_file_input
```

### Active Storage

**Simple Form Bootstrap 5 File Input** relies on [Active Storage](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/main/activestorage), so it presumes that you installed Active Storage.

### Bootstrap

**Simple Form Bootstrap 5 File Input** relies on the [Bootstrap 5](http://getbootstrap.com/) markup, so it presumes that you installed Simple Form with the Bootstrap option. To do that you have to use the `bootstrap` option in the Simple Form install generator, like this:

```console
rails generate simple_form:install --bootstrap
```

You have to be sure that you added a copy of the [Bootstrap 5](http://getbootstrap.com/)
assets on your application.

## Usage
**Simple Form Bootstrap 5 File Input** comes with one new input type which is meant to replace the standard `:file` field: `:single_deletable_file`

To start using **Simple Form Bootstrap 5 File Input** you just have to change the input type of the `:file` field to these new kind.

So basically your field:
```erb
<%= f.input :my_file %>
```
becomes
```erb
<%= f.input :my_file,
            as: :single_deletable_file %>
```
Of course you can still add the options you want, like for example `input_html: { accept: '.jpg,.jpeg,.png' }`

You can also add a direct preview (WARNING: preview can only work with images!) by using `preview: true` or any custom width for the preview: `preview: 500`. If you don't specify the preview size it will be 1000px width by default.
Note that the preview uses the boostrap classes `img-fluid` and `img-thumbnail`.

### Model
You also have to change the type of you file in your model.
So instead of declaring:
```
has_one_attached :picture
```

you will have to declare:
```
has_one_attached_deletable :picture
```

### Controller
If you use strict parameters you will need to allow the `:[filename]_delete` and the `:[filename]_infos` params in the controller.
So instead of:
```
params.require(:user).permit(:first_name, :last_name, :picture)
```
you will have:
```
params.require(:user).permit(:first_name, :last_name, :picture, :picture_delete, :picture_infos)
```

That's all folks!

## Direct upload

The new field is still compatible with the `direct_upload` param.
```erb
<%= f.input :my_file,
            as: :single_deletable_file,
            direct_upload: true %>
```
Please remember to include the `activestorage.js` library in order to use the direct_upload feature.
Direct upload will send the file BEFORE the page submission. You will get a progress bar in the file field while the file is uploading.

## Resize

You can add an option to the field to resize the image after upload (of course it has to be an image!).

Add `resize: true` to your field.

You can also specify a ratio for the cropper. For example `resize: 1` will lock the aspect ratio to a square. Beware of the float constraints in rails. If you want a 4/3 ratio use `resize: 4/3.to_f` as 4/3 otherwise gives 1.


The resizer is based on [CropperJS](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropperjs) so you have to add cropper and jquery-cropper to your dependencies:
```
yarn add cropperjs
yarn add jquery-cropper
```
then include the js files in your application.js file:
```
//= require cropperjs/dist/cropper
//= require jquery-cropper/dist/jquery-cropper
```
and include the css in your application.sass file:
```
@import 'cropperjs/dist/cropper'
```
